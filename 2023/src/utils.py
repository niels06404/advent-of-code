Advent of Code 2023 - Utils Module

This module provides utility functions for handling input files and 
running and asserting solutions for Advent of Code 2023.

Author: Niels SchrÃ¶der

Functions:
    - read_file(filepath: str) -> List[str]: Reads the content of a 
        file and returns each line as a string in a list.
    - read_puzzle_input(day: int) -> List[str]: Reads the puzzle input
        file for the given Advent of Code day.
    - run_and_assert(day: int, solution_function: callable, 
        expected_answer: any) -> None: Runs the provided solution 
        function on the example input and asserts the result.
